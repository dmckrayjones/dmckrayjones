Hello! Iâ€™m @dmckrayjones - kray is fine
- I'm here because I want to transition into a SW Engineering career. My goal is to support my family through remotely employed software engineering and start a small business. Lots of sites say GitHub is a good place to get started so here I am.
- I intend to start by reacquaint myself with SW Engineering - I studied Aerospace Engineering - and work my way into a job
- I'd love to help you collaborate on engineering and design challenges through software engineering. I'm most familiar with mechanical structures and aerodynamics but would love to learn data science methods or whatever you need help with!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Please DM me here on GitHub. I'm really excited to work with you!
